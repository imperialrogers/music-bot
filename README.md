    <p><b>I am really sorry for disappearing without saying goodbye! (｡•́︿•̀｡)</b><br>
    To be honest, I just got really tired of fighting against Google constantly blocking the bot. It was super annoying and exhausting, so I decided to stop everything overnight out of frustration.<br>
    But I've rested, and <b>I am back to maintaining the project!</b> The repo is unarchived, and I am open to contributions again. Thank you for waiting! (｡♥‿♥｡)</p>

<a id="installation"></a>
## (＾∀＾) Installation

You can run bxh-music-bot in two ways. The Docker method is recommended for most users as it's simpler and manages all dependencies for you.

### (🐳) Method 1: Docker Setup (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get the bot running.

1.  **Clone the repository and enter it:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/alan7383/bxh-music-bot.git](https://github.com/alan7383/bxh-music-bot.git)
    cd bxh-music-bot
    ```
2.  **Create your secret file:**
    Copy the example file to create your own configuration.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, **edit the `.env` file** and fill in your tokens.
    ```ini
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
    GENIUS_TOKEN=your_genius_api_token
    ```
3.  **Fire it up!**
    This command will build the container and run the bot in the background.
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```
    To view the bot's logs, use `docker compose logs -f`.

### (🛠️) Method 2: Manual Setup

> **Windows User?** Don't know anything about code? Read the [Absolute Beginner's Windows Guide](docs/windows_beginner_guide.md) created just for you! It includes a 1-click startup script.

**Requirements:**
* Python 3.9+
* FFmpeg **6.1.1** installed & in your system's PATH  
  ⬇ [Direct download (recommended version)](https://www.videohelp.com/software?d=ffmpeg-6.1.1-full_build.7z)
* Git

**Steps:**
1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/alan7383/bxh-music-bot.git](https://github.com/alan7383/bxh-music-bot.git)
    cd bxh-music-bot
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    playwright install
    ```
3.  Copy & configure environment:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    **Edit the `.env` file** with your tokens as shown in the Docker method.
4.  Run the bot:
    ```bash
    python bxh-music-bot.py
    ```

### Inviting the Bot to Discord (for both methods)
* Go to your Discord Developer Portal.
* Enable the **Guilds**, **Voice States**, and **Message Content** intents for your bot.
* Generate an invite link with the `Connect`, `Speak`, and `Send Messages` permissions.
* Add the bot to your server and enjoy `/play`!

### Health Check Server (for Render & Hosting Platforms)

The bot includes a built-in HTTP health check server that prevents services like Render from spinning down due to inactivity.

**Endpoints:**
* `/health` - Returns JSON with bot status and uptime
* `/ping` - Simple text response ("pong") for basic health checks
* `/status` - Detailed bot information with formatted uptime

**Configuration:**
* The server runs automatically on port **8080** by default
* You can override the port using the `PORT` environment variable
* The server runs in a daemon thread and won't block bot startup

**For Render.com:**
1. Deploy your bot to Render as a Web Service (not Background Worker)
2. Render will automatically ping your service to keep it alive
3. Your service URL will be: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`
4. Render pings the root URL (`/`) automatically, which returns health status

**For other platforms (Railway, Fly.io, etc.):**
1. Set up a cron job or uptime monitor (like UptimeRobot or Cron-Job.org)
2. Configure it to ping: `https://your-app-url.com/health`
3. Recommended interval: **10-14 minutes**
4. This prevents the service from spinning down due to inactivity

**Testing locally:**
```bash
# Start the bot, then in another terminal:
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/ping
curl http://localhost:8080/status
```

## (╥_╥) Public Bot Status

**The public bot is currently discontinued.**

Unfortunately, due to stricter limitations from Google and YouTube, the public instance was detected as a bot and blocked. Maintaining a public instance that serves thousands of servers became impossible without hitting these bans constantly.

To use bxh-music-bot, please **self-host** it using the [Docker](#installation) or manual methods above! It's much safer and ensures your music won't be interrupted.

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
## (｀・ω・´) Troubleshooting

* **FFmpeg not found**: Ensure FFmpeg **6.1.1** is installed & in your system's PATH. On Windows, the bot expects it in the `bin/` folder if not in PATH. (Docker setup handles this for you!)  
  ⬇ [Download FFmpeg 6.1.1](https://www.videohelp.com/software?d=ffmpeg-6.1.1-full_build.7z)
* **Spotify errors**: Verify your API credentials in the `.env` file.
* **Bot offline/unresponsive**: Check your `DISCORD_TOKEN` and bot permissions in the Developer Portal.
* **Direct link issues**: Ensure the URL points directly to an audio file and is publicly accessible.
